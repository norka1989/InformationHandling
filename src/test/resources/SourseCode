It has survived - not only (five) centuries, but also the leap into 13<<2 electronic
typesetting, remaining 3>>5 essentially ~6&9|(3&4) unchanged. It was popularized in the
5(1&2&(3|(4&(^5|6&47)|3)|2)|1) with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lnrem Ipsum
passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
versions uf Lorem lpsum.

It is a long-established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
page when looking at its  layout. The point using (~71&(2&3|(3|(2&1>>2|2)&2)|10&2))|78
lpsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using (Content
here), content here', making it look like readable English.

It is a (^5|1&2<<(2|5>>2&71))|1200 established fact that a reader will be of a page when
looking at its layout.

Bye.
